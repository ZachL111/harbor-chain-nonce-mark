# Review Journal

The repository goal stays the same: implement a C blockchain tooling project for nonce resource planning, using capacity fixtures and allocation and spill reports. This note explains the added review angle.

The local checks classify each case as `ship`, `watch`, or `hold`. That gives the project a small review vocabulary that matches its blockchain tooling focus without claiming live deployment or external usage.

## Cases

- `baseline`: `event finality`, score 168, lane `ship`
- `stress`: `nonce pressure`, score 202, lane `ship`
- `edge`: `settlement risk`, score 116, lane `watch`
- `recovery`: `proof depth`, score 244, lane `ship`
- `stale`: `event finality`, score 149, lane `ship`

## Note

A future change should add new cases before it changes the scoring rule.
